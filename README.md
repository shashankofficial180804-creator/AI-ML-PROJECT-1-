# AI-ML-PROJECT-1
Titanic dataset exploratory data analysis using Python and Pandas. The project focuses on understanding data structure, identifying numerical and categorical features, analyzing missing values, class imbalance, and assessing dataset suitability for machine learning tasks.
# Titanic Dataset Analysis (EDA)

This project performs exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset using Python and Pandas as part of an AI & ML internship task.

## What I Did
- Loaded and inspected the Titanic CSV dataset
- Identified numerical, categorical, ordinal, and binary features
- Analyzed data types, missing values, and statistical summaries
- Checked unique values in categorical columns
- Identified the target variable and input features
- Examined dataset size and class imbalance
- Wrote observations on data quality and ML readiness

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Objective
To understand the structure and quality of a real-world dataset before applying machine learning models.

## Final Outcome:
As an Intern I understood data structure, types, and ML readiness of dataset.
